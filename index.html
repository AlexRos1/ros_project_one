  Hello. If you don't know me, I'm Alex Ros. Currently a senior
  majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Mathematics, concentrating
  on Software Development. Do I think I'm going to get a job after
  I graduate? Probably not, I wanted to switch to majoring in Creative
  Writing for over a year now but here we are. Welcome to my website.
  I don't even like programmimg.
